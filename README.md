Check-in 1: 
rectangles appear and undo redo also work. When you add more rectangles after undoing an action you cannot redo that action. This was a purposeful design decision to avoid having 2 stacks and redoing work that could mess up new work. The code runs, but I am getting warnings from intellij on the add event listener file.
